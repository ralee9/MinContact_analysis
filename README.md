# MinContact_analysis

A repository of assorted Python scripts to analyze voltage data from a psychophysics experiment.

Data are collected at 1 kHz and stored as rows, each voltage source as its own column.

Run _RawDataProcessing.py to split data and create initial graphs
Run _DataStatistics.py to obtain mean, standard deviation, power, and contact time statistics

Scripts _avgSEM_grapher.py and _avgPower_grapher.py use matplotlib to create figures for 
publication
